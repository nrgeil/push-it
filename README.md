### Installation

Create a sample clip of whatever you want to play during a force push. Personally, I went with 
Salt-N-Pepa's Push It but you can use whatever you want. Instructions for downloading/creating
a sample mp3 file can be found all over the internet.

Copy the pre-push file into `.git/hooks` for your project and update the path to your
mp3 file. Make sure it is executable or it won't work.
