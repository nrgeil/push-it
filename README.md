This has been tested only on macOS. To get it to work on other operating systems, update the
afplay command to whatever command line tool on your system that will play music files. 

### Installation

Create a sample clip of whatever you want to play during a force push. Personally, I went with 
Salt-N-Pepa's Push It but you can use whatever you want. Instructions for downloading/creating
a sample mp3 file can be found all over the internet.

Copy the pre-push file into `.git/hooks` for your project and update the path to your
mp3 file. Make sure it is executable or it won't work.
